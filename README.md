# Super-Store-Sales-Dashboard
A fully interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Superstore Sales data across payment modes, customer segments, regions, shipping methods, and product categories. This project highlights key KPIs such as Total Sales, Profit, Order Count, and Monthly Trends, demonstrating strong data storytelling and analytical skills.

## Project Objective
The Super Store Sales Dashboard project aims to visualize and analyze key sales metrics of a retail dataset using interactive and dynamic visuals. The main objective is to provide a clear and insightful overview of sales performance, allowing users to track trends and identify patterns across various dimensions such as:

- Payment Modes
- Customer Segments
- Geographic Regions
- Shipping Modes
- Product Categories and Subcategories
- Monthly Sales and Profits
- Shipping Days

This project is not developed for a specific client or business need but rather serves as a demonstration of my analytical and data visualization skills. It is intended for inclusion in my GitHub portfolio to showcase my proficiency in building data-driven dashboards using business intelligence tools.
By turning raw sales data into meaningful insights through visual storytelling, the dashboard offers an intuitive way to explore sales distribution, profitability, and operational aspects of a retail business. The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle 

## The used tools and technologies
- Power BI (data modeling, DAX, visualizations)
- Kaggle (data source)
- DAX (measures for KPIs and comparative analysis)
- Power Query (data transformation and cleaning)

## Data Preparation & Cleaning

The raw dataset was initially imported from an Excel file into Power BI. Extensive data cleaning and transformation operations were performed using Power Query, including:
- Converting data types to appropriate formats (e.g., dates, numbers, text)
- Renaming columns for better readability and consistency
- Creating additional time-related columns such as:
  - Week Numbers
  - Day Names (e.g., Monday, Tuesday)
  - Month Names (e.g., January, February)

These transformations ensured that the data was clean, structured, and optimized for effective analysis and visualization.
